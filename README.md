MARKIE BOT
This chatbot, Markie, is a personal marketing assistant designed to generate creative product names and taglines. It uses Google's Gemini AI to suggest three unique product names along with catchy and relatable taglines that mix Hindi and English for added appeal.

How it Works:
User Interaction:

Markie asks if the user wants to generate a name and tagline.

If the user agrees, Markie collects details like product category, idea, and target audience.

AI-Powered Generation:

It formulates a structured prompt using the inputs.

The Gemini AI model generates three unique names and their taglines.

Conversational Flow:

If the user enters "bye", Markie politely ends the conversation.

If the user declines, Markie says goodbye.

If input is invalid, it prompts again.
